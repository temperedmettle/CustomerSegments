# CustomerSegments
"Creating Customer Segments" is an unsupervised learning project for my Machine Learning Nanodegree program.

In this project, I have analyzed a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories. Using clustering to identify different types of customers can help a wholesale distributor structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
